# SSMS17 Code Snippets
This repository contains several XML code snippets for code that I've found myself re-using in Sql Server Management Studio (SSMS) 17. The snippets have been formatted to reflect the format used in the plugin named "Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter". 

If you would like to use these snippets, you need to download the code and move them inside a folder called "My Code Snippets". 
To find the path to this folder, you have to open up the Code Snippet Manager in SSMS17 or later and click on this folder. You should be able to see the path in the window. If you are familiar with XML, feel free to modify the code to suit your needs.

If you would like to contribute to this repository, please get in touch with me as I'm focusing on writing snippets for very basic T-SQL statements.
