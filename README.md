# SSMS17 Code Snippets
This repository contains several (custom) XML code snippets for code that I've found myself re-using in Sql Server Management Studio (SSMS) 17 as a result of being enrolled in PROG140. 

The snippets have been formatted to reflect the format used in the plugin named [Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter](http://architectshack.com/PoorMansTSqlFormatter.ashx). 

## Using The Snippets
If you would like to use these custom snippets, you need to download the code and import it to SSMS17. You can do by following these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/scripting/add-transact-sql-snippets?view=sql-server-2017) in Microsoft's documentation.

## Contributing Changes
If you would like to contribute to this repository and are familiar with the [code snippet schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets-schema-reference?view=vs-2015), please get in touch with me as I'm focusing on writing snippets for very basic T-SQL statements.
